# MATLAB Code for Finite Element Analysis (FEA)

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation for the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of a 2D thin plate under plane stress conditions. The analysis focuses on:

- Calculation of nodal displacements and element strains using 3-node and 6-node triangular elements.


## Features
- **Element Types:** Support for 3-node linear triangular elements and 6-node quadratic triangular elements.
- **Material Properties:** Customizable elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, and thickness.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Configurable fixed supports and applied forces.
- **Post-Processing:** Extraction and visualization of nodal displacements and element strains.
